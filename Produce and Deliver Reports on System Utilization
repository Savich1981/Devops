1. Create a directory in your home directory called "reports". Create a file called 'systemuse.rep' using any method you choose.

root@tcox1:~# mkdir reports

root@tcox1:~# cd reports

root@tcox1:~/reports# echo "SYSTEM USAGE REPORT - TODAY'S DATE HERE" >> systemuse.rep

 

 

2. Run a command that pipes it's output to the 'systemuse.rep' file. The command should display all current commands being run by the user in the current shell.

 root@tcox1:~/reports# echo "PROCESSES BY USER IN TERMINAL" >> systemuse.rep && ps >> systemuse.rep

 

3. Using the appropriate command, append to the 'systemuse.rep' file the system load and all mount points present on the system, in 'human readable' format.

root@tcox1:~/reports# echo "CURRENT MOUNT DRIVES AND MOUNTS IN READABLE FORMAT" >> systemuse.rep && df -h >> systemuse.rep 
root@tcox1:~/reports# echo "CURRENT SYSTEM LOAD" >> systemuse.rep && w >> systemuse.rep
 

4. List all the directories in the /var directory such that their total disk usage, by directory, is appended to the 'systemuse.rep' file, again in 'human readable' format.

echo "DISK USAGE IN VAR, BY DIRECTORY, BY SIZE" >> systemuse.rep && du -sch /var/* | sort >> systemuse.rep 

 

5. Run the appropriate command to show the available memory in the system, in megabytes, appended to the 'systemuse.rep' file.

root@tcox1:~/reports# echo "AVAILABLE MEMORY, IN MEGABYTES" >> systemuse.rep && free -m >> systemuse.rep

 

6. Display the 'systemuse.rep' file to verify it contains the output expected from Steps #1 through #5.

root@tcox1:~/reports# cat systemuse.rep
